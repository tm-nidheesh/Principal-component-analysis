# PCA_Feature-selection
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving the most important information. It transforms a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space by identifying the principal components, which are the directions of maximum variance in the data.

# Benefits of PCA:
1. Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces the number of features, simplifying analysis and improving computational efficiency.<br>
2. Noise Reduction: Can remove noise and irrelevant features from the data.<br>
3. Visualization: Makes it easier to visualize high-dimensional data.<br>
4. Feature Engineering: Can be used to create new features that are linear combinations of the original features.<br>

# Advantages
1. Reduces complexity in high-dimensional data.<br>
2. Removes multicollinearity.<br>
3. Can help in improving model performance.<br>

# Limitations
1. Linear transformation only, may not capture non-linear relationships.<br>
2. Sensitive to scale of features (requires standardization).<br>
3. May lose some interpretability of original features.<br>
